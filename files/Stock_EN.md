### 1. Create MR or RN Form
* **Notes System and SAP System**
    - Open the `MX MR & RN` system
    - Click the `New MR` button, or `NEW RN` for RN
    - Select `Type` as `Departmental Drawing` and click `OK`
    - Choose `Reason Code` (as needed)
    - Select the department
    - Enter the production line number (if applicable for the production department)
    - Enter the corresponding customer code in `Customer`
    - Enter remarks in `Remake`
    - Enter part number and quantity in `PN` and `Qty`
    - If there are too many, use the `Import` tool to import the required data, only fill in the part number and quantity in the table
    - After completing the above steps, initiate the approval and wait for the relevant leaders to approve, then use SAP
    - **MR Form**
        - Enter transaction code `ZMMMR` in SAP
        - Enter the MR number generated in `MR NO` and `6501` in `Plant`
        - After entering the interface, check the materials that need to be deducted
        - Click `Post Goods Issue`
    - **RN Form**
        - Enter transaction code `ZRNWH` in SAP
        - Enter the RN number generated in `MR/RN Number` and `6501` in `Plant`
        - After entering the interface, check the materials that need to be added
        - Select `Select Batch` from the toolbar
        - Then check the material, enter the location in `SLoc`, and click `OK`
        - Click `Post Goods Issue`
